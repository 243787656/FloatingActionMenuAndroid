Floating Action Menu for Android
This project is inspired from Gmail like Floating Action Menu in Android App. Tested it on both Lollipop and Pre lollipop with Android Support Library. Also tested the new ConstraintLayout, Data Binding, and  Cursive Font-Family. The Font-Family attribute works only for API level 26 and above.

Soon I'll add the Navigation Drawer to the same Activity and Floating Action Menu will have a smooth transition in its Alpha range to hide and show on Drawer open/close.
